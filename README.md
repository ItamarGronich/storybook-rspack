# Storybook Rspack

Make storybook work with Rspack.

This monorepo includes two packages:

1. `@gitamar/storybook-builder-rspack`: A custom storybook builder that uses Rspack
2. `@gitamar/storybook-framework-react-rspack`: A storybook framework that uses Rspack and React

they are mostly copied from the official storybook packages and modified to work with Rspack.
